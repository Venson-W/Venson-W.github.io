        I'm a second-year PhD student at the <a href="http://seismo.ethz.ch/en/home/" target="_blank">Swiss Seismological Service</a> and the <a href="https://erdw.ethz.ch/en/" target="_blank">Department of Earth Sciences</a>, <a href="https://ethz.ch/de.html" target="_blank">ETH ZÃ¼rich</a>. 
        Before joining ETHZ, I earned my Master's degree in Geological Engineering from <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/" target="_blank">Tongji University</a>, Shanghai. Previously, I spent four years majoring in Civil Engineering at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_South_University" target="_blank">Central South University</a> in Changsha, during which I also spent six months at <a href="https://www.monash.edu/" target="_blank">Monash University</a> (Melbourne) for my Bachelor's thesis. 
        In my PhD project, I am keen on understanding the across-scale behavior of fault slip and earthquake cycles concerning fault-fluid interactions, using efficient numerical schemes. Broadly, my research interests focus on scientific computing, porous media, and granular matter, particularly in their correlation with a plethora of geological hazards.
