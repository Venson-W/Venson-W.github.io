        I'm a second-year PhD student at the [Swiss Seismological Service](http://seismo.ethz.ch/en/home/) and the [Department of Earth Sciences](https://erdw.ethz.ch/en/), [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/de.html). Before joining ETHZ, I earned my Master's degree in Geological Engineering from [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/), Shanghai. Previously, I spent four years majoring in Civil Engineering at [Central South University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_South_University) in Changsha, during which I also spent six months at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/) (Melbourne) for my Bachelor's thesis. In my PhD project, I am keen on understanding the across-scale behavior of fault slip and earthquake cycles concerning fault-fluid interactions, using efficient numerical schemes. Broadly, my research interests focus on scientific computing, porous media, and granular matter, particularly in their correlation with a plethora of geological hazards.
